I'm just some guy, it doesn't really matter. Still, I wanted to have a spot to jolt down (and share) notes, thoughts and ideas and not be dependent on any platform that would make ***you*** the product. Hence, this website. 

(European) Portuguese is my native language but I usually write in English as I've got friends and acquaintances from different cultures and languages - English encompasses more people.

I'm trying to write as succinctly as I can. I want to be sparse with words.

As I write more posts I'll add more info here on the About page :)

*For the geeks in the audience, this website is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) :link: and based on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) :link:(with a neat theme called [Swiss](https://broccolini.net/swiss/):link:). I write posts with [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and  then Jekyll converts it to html. It's all very much static, ad-free, cookies- and tracking-free, etc. > [proof](https://themarkup.org/blacklight?url=pedrohomero.com):link: < *
