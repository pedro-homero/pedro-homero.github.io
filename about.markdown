I'm just some guy, it doesn't really matter. Still, I wanted to have a spot to jolt down (and share) some notes, thoughts and ideas and not be dependent on any platform that would make you the product. Hence, the website. 



I'm Portuguese but I usually write in English as I've got friends and acquaintances from different cultures and languages - English emcompasses most people.

As I write more posts I'll add more info here on the about page :)



[For the geek in the audience, it's hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and based on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) (with a neat theme called [Swiss](https://broccolini.net/swiss/)). I write posts with [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and  then Jekyll converts it to html. It's all very much static, ad-free, cookies- and tracking-free, etc.]
