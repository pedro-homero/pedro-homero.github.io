So...

I wanted to create my own website to

1. share thoughts and ideas

2. not being dependent on social media or other platforms to do it

3. feed my need to share while moving away from social media

4. allow you the reader to be totally free from ads, tracking or any other privacy violation when reading what I share

5. learn [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)!

I also want to train my ability to be succinct. Sharing what I want to say in the least amount of words. 
It's a 2-way street: I save you, the reader, time, and I focus on the content, instead of letting myself be enamoured by my words.

It's a bit like design itself. Functional. Simple. Focused. That's the goal, anyway - let's see if I succeed. 

Thanks for reading!
