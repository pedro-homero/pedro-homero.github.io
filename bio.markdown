So you want to know a bit more about me? Ok.

* :older_man: 47 years old

* :purple_heart: feminist

* :fist: anti-fascist (and all dictatorships in general). I swing between democratic socialism and full-fledged anarchism, depending on my level of hope in humanity.

* :open_hands: secular humanist

* :boy::boy:father of 2 amazing kids (8 and 10 years old)

* :joy_cat:co-parent for 5 crazy (and cute) cats

* :people_holding_hands:In a loving and caring consensual non-monogamous relationship (*ToDo - write a post about this*)

* :bike: bycicle riding enthusiast!

* :man:boring cis white male (conscious of all the privilege it entails)

* :rainbow_flag:ally to the queer community (tentatively, queer, as a term, feels to me more encompassing than LGBTQIA+, but I'm open to great arguments otherwise)

* :earth_africa:swinging between believing we're doomed vs. we can still avoid total climate disaster - ask me how I feel today! :upside_down_face:

* :seedling:vegetarian

* :movie_camera::headphones:film and music enthusiast

* :computer:recruiter (check my [LinkedIn](linked.incom/in/pedrohomero) if interested)
