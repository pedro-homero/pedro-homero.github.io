So you want to know a bit more about me? Ok.

* :older_man: 47 years old

* :purple_heart: feminist

* :fist: anti-fascist (and all dictatorships in general). I swing between democratic socialism and full-fledged anarchism, depending on my level of hope in humanity.

* :open_hands: secular humanist

* :boy::boy: father of 2 amazing kids (~~8~~ 9 and ~~10~~11 years old)

* :joy_cat::joy_cat::joy_cat::joy_cat::joy_cat: co-parent for 5 crazy (and cute) cats

* :heart: In a loving and caring [**consensual non-monogamous relationship**]({% post_url 2022-11-08-consensual-non-monogamy %}) 

* :bike: bycicle riding enthusiast!

* :man: boring cis white hetero male (yet conscious of all the privilege it entails)

* :rainbow_flag: ally to the queer community (tentatively, queer, as a term, feels to me more encompassing than LGBTQIA+, but I'm open to great counter arguments)

* :earth_africa: swinging between believing we're doomed vs. we can still avoid total climate disaster - ask me how I feel today! :upside_down_face:

* :seedling: vegetarian

* :movie_camera::headphones: film and music enthusiast

* :computer: recruiter (check my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedrohomero) :link: if interested)

I haven't implemented a commenting system yet (I'm still trying to see if there's one that is privacy-conscious and free - both as in *libre* as well as in *gratis*) but if you'd like to comment or ask me any questions feel free to reach me via email on `pedro.homero at gmail dot com` (or via social media if we happen to be connected in any of them).
